# AoE2-DE-predictor
Convolutional neural network predictor of Age of Empires 2 DE matches. 

Neural networks are taking over the world now, and i have always wanted to learn how to use them. This proyect is meant for me to learn about machine learning while aplying it to a good all game many of us know: Age of Empires 2.

This is a proyect made in colaboration with Mateo Coifman (mateokoifman@gmail.com).

In Age of Empires 2, each game stars with a randomly generated map. The program designed in this proyect contains a trained neural network that given the starting map generation, the player's civilizations and their ELO (score that punctuates how likely each player is to win) predicts which player will actually win, giving a better accuracy than just looking at each player's ELO.
